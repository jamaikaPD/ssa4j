Screen-Scaper Annotations for Java (ssa4j) is a framework designed to simplify the creation of Java APIs for [Screen-Scraper](http://www.screen-scraper.com) scraping sessions. Instead of having to create tedious "glue" code, SSA4J enables the developer to rapidly define APIs as simple POJOs that are simple to use and maintain.

**BONUS!** The framework also provides a comprehensive "mocking" framework (see [SSA4JMock](SSA4JMock.md)), that enables you to test your POJOs without actually invoking screen-scraper.

**NOTE** The ssa4j framework will work with both professional and enterprise editions of the screen-scraper product.
